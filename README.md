# Facial Expression and Amusement Ratings Study

This repository contains the analysis and report for a study investigating the relationship between facial expressions and amusement ratings, inspired by the facial feedback hypothesis.

## Project Overview

This study aims to replicate and extend the work of Strack et al. (1988) on the facial feedback hypothesis. We analyzed a pre-existing dataset to examine whether different facial expressions (smiling, pouting, and neutral) influence participants' amusement ratings when viewing amusing video clips.

## Key Findings

- No statistically significant difference was found in amusement ratings between the three facial expression conditions.
- Participants' baseline mood (MoodPre) was significantly related to amusement ratings.
- The results did not support the original findings of Strack et al. (1988).
